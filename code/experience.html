            <p>I have successfully completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, where I gained strong foundational knowledge in programming, database systems, software development, and web technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I actively participated in practical learning, developing multiple projects that strengthened both my technical and problem-solving skills. My final year project, AgroPro, helped me understand real-world challenges and build solutions tailored to users’ needs. <br> I also worked as an Intern at Yetram HR Solutions, where I developed a Bike Wash Service Booking Website as my primary project. During this internship, I worked on both frontend and backend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I implemented features such as booking facility, email notifications, admin dashboard, and distance-based pickup cost calculations. This experience improved my knowledge of web development, teamwork, version control with GitHub, and handling project requirements professionally. It also boosted my confidence to work on large-scale applications in the future.</p>
